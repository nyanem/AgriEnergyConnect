# AgriEnergyConnect

The **Agri-Energy Connect Platform** is a web-based system designed to connect farmers with energy and sustainability initiatives. Built using ASP.NET Core MVC and SQL Server, the platform allows employees to manage farmer records and products, and farmers to manage their own product data.

This application is a prototype developed as part of a software development module and demonstrates CRUD operations, role-based access control (under development), and future readiness for cloud deployment and performance scaling.
